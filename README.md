# Data Processing
# a python code that utilize one of the plotting library to process LS-DYNA logs. Where you (and whoever would like to use the script) can specify the path to the log file, their x-axis and y-axis as well as the range of the data you want to plot. The script will then open the log file and read all the logs. Then, select the data range you need to plot and plot these data. Then, the next step would be a batch processing, which allow you to include the directory of logs, and process multiple log files at the same time.
